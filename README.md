**NOTE: This application was built using JavaScript, Jquery, HTML5, CSS, Parallax, and Materialize. The Itunes API and Seatgeek API were used as well. **


This fullstack application allows users to search for music events by zipcode. This search by zipcode will trigger an AJAX call to the seatgeek API, and the user will receive a list of events within a predetermined radius of 20 miles, and the option to purchase tickets to the event. 

Should the user want to listen to a sample track from a performer they might want to see, they will have the option to search by artist name. This search will trigger an AJAX call to the Itunes API, and will return a 30 second preview track.
